# Videojson
This is my video game version of the json program

This code is for use of documenting each game in the list by various means.

My dataset uses different games and sorts their info by Title, Gender of the protagonist, Line of sight, Genre, if it contains Multiplayer, violence, or Creative mode. 

Here is an example data set for the Saint's Row game. 

'{"Title" : "Saints Row", "GenderofProtagongist": "Both", "LineofSight": "3rd person", "Genre": "Adventure", "Contains Multiplayer": true, "Contains Violence": true, "Contains Creative Mode": true}',

My filter-node filters which games came out after the year 2000.

My oldest (couldnt figure out how to change it's name) maps the next year a sequel will be released for each game.
